********** Test BusArrival - Started **********


1. Testing Constructors and toString:

	1. Testing Constructor with 5 parameters BusArrival(int lineNum, int pass, int h, int m, int s):
	BusArrival ba1 is: (should be: Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers)
	Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers

	2. Testing Constructor with 3 parameters BusArrival(int lineNum, int pass, Time1 t):
	BusArrival ba2 is: (should be: Bus no. 9 arrived at 12:30:55 with 15 passengers)
	Bus no. 9 arrived at 12:30:55 with 15 passengers

	3. Testing Copy Constructor parameters BusArrival(BusArrival other):
	BusArrival ba2 (constructed using ba1) is: (should be: Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers)
	Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers


2.1. Testing accessors (getters):

	BusArrival ba1 is:
	Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers

	1. Testing getLineNum():
	line number is :18 (should be 18)

	2. Testing getNoOfPass():
	number of passengers is :3 (should be 3)

	3. Testing getArrivalTime():
	arrival time is:10:25:40 (should be: 10:25:40)


2.2. Testing mutators (setters):

	BusArrival ba1 is:
	Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers

	1. Testing setLineNum(int num):
	line number is : 25 (was 18, but now should be 25)

	2. Testing setNoOfPass(int num):
	number of passengers is : 14 (was 3, but now should be 14)

	3. Testing setArrivalTime(Time1 t):
	arrival time is : 16:15:20 (was 10:25:40, but now should be: 16:15:20)


3. Testing equals() method:

	BusArrival ba1 is:
	Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers

	BusArrival ba2 is:
	Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers

	Test results:
	Passed: bas1 is the same BusArrival as ba2


4. Testing fuller() method:

	BusArrival ba1 is:
	Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers

	BusArrival ba2 is:
	Bus no. 28 arrived at 10:40:45 with 13 passengers

	Test results:
	Passed: ba2 (13 passengers) is fuller than ba1 (3 passengers)


5. Testing before() method:

	BusArrival ba1 is:
	Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers

	BusArrival ba2 is:
	Bus no. 28 arrived at 10:40:45 with 13 passengers

	Test results:
	Passed: ba1 arrival time (10:25:40) is before ba2 arrival time (10:40:45)


6. Testing isFull() method:

	BusArrival ba1 is:
	Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers
	Passed: ba1 (3 passengers) is NOT full


7. Testing elapsedTime() method:

	BusArrival ba1 is:
	Bus no. 18 arrived at 10:25:40 with 3 passengers

	BusArrival ba2 is:
	Bus no. 28 arrived at 10:40:45 with 13 passengers

	Test results:
	PASSED: ba1.elapsedTime(b2) == 15
